## Attention Grabber:
• In 2022, 73% of total worldwide revenue of the mobile games industry was generated by but a mere 15% of mobile games that monetized through loot boxes and/or gacha mechanics.
Yet there appear to be almost no succesful indies game in said genre. We're here to fix that.
## Problem Statement:
• High costs of running live-service games and especially the Greed of the Triple-A Companies makes player exploitation incredibily prevalent within the industry.
•Even The European Union recently intrudced guidelines on how the predatory game mechanics should be minimized and preferably removed.
## Our Philosophy:
For a live-service game to be succesful it needs a loyal playbase willing to support it, which is the number one thing, studios all over the world get wrong and why their games fail.
• We not only want to build a profitible game, but a tight-knitted community.
## Sustainable Revenue:
This being an Indie Project, we can keep the costs low, with a small group of developers and proportionally small servers with easily expandable architecture.
• Using a strategy of proportional growth, we can start small and eventually reach the point of profitability.
## Balance:
• Healthy business and Happy Players can indeed co-exist. And we're here to prove it with a Fun, Easy-To-Learn, Hard-To-Master, Card-Based Gameplay, team building mechanics and intresting characters.
