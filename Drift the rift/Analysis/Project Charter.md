## Project charter: Drift The Rift  

### Project pitch 

Attention Grabber:

• In 2022, 73% of total worldwide revenue of the mobile games industry was generated by but a mere 15% of mobile games that monetized through loot boxes and/or gacha mechanics. Yet there appear to be almost no succesful indies game in said genre. We're here to fix that.

Problem Statement:

• High costs of running live-service games and especially the Greed of the Triple-A Companies makes player exploitation incredibily prevalent within the industry. •Even The European Union recently intrudced guidelines on how the predatory game mechanics should be minimized and preferably removed.

Our Philosophy:

For a live-service game to be succesful it needs a loyal playbase willing to support it, which is the number one thing, studios all over the world get wrong and why their games fail. • We not only want to build a profitible game, but a tight-knitted community.

Sustainable Revenue:

This being an Indie Project, we can keep the costs low, with a small group of developers and proportionally small servers with easily expandable architecture. • Using a strategy of proportional growth, we can start small and eventually reach the point of profitability.

Balance:

• Healthy business and Happy Players can indeed co-exist. And we're here to prove it with a Fun Easy-To-Learn Hard-To-Master Card-Based Gameplay and intresting characters.
